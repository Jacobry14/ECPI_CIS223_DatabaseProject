# ECPI_CIS223_DatabaseProject

This was my final project for my CIS223 Introduction to Databases at ECPI

Throughout this class we used Microsoft Access to create, manage, and querry databasses

Prior to taking this class I had already taken the two SQL classes EPIC offered so I was already knowledgeable about the SQL language.
